# WindowsVPN
Data being mirrored between two EXPRESSCLUSTER servers is currently unencrypted. One way to provide a more secure data stream is through a VPN connection. 3rd party VPN software exists but can be expensive or complicated to set up. Windows servers have a VPN feature which can be installed and configured without too much difficulty. This project will explain how to set up a basic VPN server which can be used with EXPRESSCLUSTER to securely transfer data between two ECX servers.  
\*Note that the configuration guide is just one of many variations on how to configure a VPN server.
